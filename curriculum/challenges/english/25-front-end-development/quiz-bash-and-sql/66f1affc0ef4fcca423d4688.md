### --question--

#### --text--

Placeholder question

#### --distractors--

SQL is a compiled language, whereas Python and Java are interpreted languages.

---

SQL is mainly used for the back-end website, whereas Python and Java are used in front-end website development.

---

SQL is case-sensitive, whereas Python and Java are case-insensitive.

#### --answer--

SQL is a specialized language for managing data in relational databases, while languages like Python or Java have a broader range of applications.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of these statements best describes the fundamental nature and purpose of SQL?

#### --distractors--

SQL is a procedural programming language designed specifically for building an interactive web application but it relies heavily on database interaction to generate dynamic content.

---

SQL is a programming language that allows developers direct access to a computer's hardware in order to maximize the efficiency at which data is stored and retrieved from the database.

---

SQL is a markup language that marks, formats, and structures data for presentation on a web page such that they would be viewable through any web browser.

#### --answer--

SQL is a query language used to retrieve specific information from data tables within a relational database management system.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is an example of why it is important to know when to use fixed-length and when to use variable-length data types in SQL?

#### --distractors--

To hold a list of telephone numbers since, in most systems, telephone numbers are either strictly character or numeric and therefore have a fixed length.

---

To hold product prices since price is generally held as a numeric or monetary value.

---

To hold dates of birth, since each date follows the same format.

#### --answer--

To hold customer reviews, since the length of reviews may vary to a great extent.

### --question--

#### --text--

If a database designer mistakenly chooses `INTEGER` as the data type to hold customer loyalty points when in fact the points may include fractional values, most probably, what happens?

#### --distractors--

The database will deny accepting any insert operation when there are points with fractional values to avoid any inaccuracies in the system.

---

SQL will change the data type automatically to DECIMAL or FLOAT to accommodate the fractional values.

---

The database will store the fractional points in text strings form. Storage space increases with complication in calculations.

#### --answer--

The fractional part of the points will be truncated, leading to a loss of data accuracy and potentially causing customer dissatisfaction.

### --question--

---

`Title: VARCHAR, PublicationYear: INTEGER, IsAvailable: TEXT`

---

`Title: CHAR(100), PublicationYear: INTEGER, IsAvailable: VARCHAR(3)`

#### --answer--

`Title: VARCHAR, PublicationYear: INTEGER, IsAvailable: BOOLEAN`

---

`>> errors.log`

#### --answer--

`2> errors.log`

### --question--

You are working on a Linux system and need to write a bash script that performs these tasks:

1. List all files and folders, including hidden ones, within the `/home/user` directory.
2. Copy all `.txt` files from the `/home/user` directory to a folder named `text_backup` within the current directory.
3. Delete all files with the `.tmp` extension in the `/home/user` directory, asking for confirmation before deleting each file.

#### --distractors--

```bash
ls -a /home/user
cp *.txt text_backup/
rm -i *.tmp
```

---

```bash
ls -a /home/user
cp *.txt /home/user/text_backup/
rm -rf /home/user/*.tmp
```

---

```bash
ls -a /home/user
cp /home/user/*.txt /home/user/text_backup/
rm -i *.tmp
```

#### --answer--

```bash
ls -a /home/user
cp /home/user/*.txt text_backup/
rm -i /home/user/*.tmp 
```

You are designing a database for a music store. You need to keep track of albums and their artists. You have two tables:

**Table: Albums**

```md
| Column Name | Data Type  | Constraints |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| AlbumID     | INT        | PRIMARY KEY |
| AlbumTitle   | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| ReleaseYear  | INT        |             |
```

**Table: Artists**

```md
| Column Name | Data Type  | Constraints |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| ArtistID    | INT        | PRIMARY KEY |
| ArtistName  | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
```

You need to ensure that each album is associated with the correct artist.  

**Question:** What is the best way to represent the relationship between the Albums table and Artists table, given that an artist can have multiple albums? 


#### --distractors--

Add a column named `ArtistName` to the Albums table.

---

Add a column named `AlbumTitle` to the Artists table.

---

Create a new table called `AlbumsArtists` with both `AlbumID` and `ArtistID`  as foreign keys.

#### --answer--

Add a column named `ArtistID` to the Albums table as a foreign key referencing the `ArtistID` in the Artists table.

### --question--

#### --text--

You have been given a task to create a database that can hold information of customers and their addresses for some company. You would assume that you are to record all the details of the customers and should let a customer hold multiple addresses.

Consider the following two tables:

**Table: Customers**

```md
| Column Name | Data Type    | Constraints |
| :---------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| CustomerID  | INT          | PRIMARY KEY |
| FirstName   | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| LastName    | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| Email       | VARCHAR(255) |             |
```

**Table: Addresses**

```md
| Column Name | Data Type    | Constraints |
| :---------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| AddressID   | INT          | PRIMARY KEY |
| CustomerID  | INT          |             |
| Street      | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| City        | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| State       | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL   |
| ZipCode     | VARCHAR(10)  | NOT NULL   |
```

**Question:** How would you best establish the relationship between the Customers and Addresses tables, so that the address is correctly associated with a given customer, given the fact that each customer can have more than one address?

#### --distractors--

Add a column named `AddressID` to the Customers table.

---

Add columns for `Street`, `City`, `State`, and `ZipCode` to the Customers table.

---

Combine the Customers and Addresses tables into a single table.

#### --answer--

Add a column named `CustomerID` to the Addresses table as a foreign key referencing the `CustomerID` in the Customers table.

---

Union-based SQL injection

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a parameterized query, and how does it help prevent SQL injection attacks?

#### --distractors--

A parameterized query is a pre-compiled SQL statement stored on the database server, making it immune to code injection.

---

A parameterized query is a SQL statement that is dynamically generated by the application code, making it more difficult for attackers to predict.

---

A parameterized query is a SQL statement that is encrypted before being sent to the database server, making it impossible for attackers to read or modify.

#### --answer--

A parameterized query is a SQL statement that uses placeholders for user-supplied values, which are treated separately from the query code by the database server.
